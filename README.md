Parks application

This map is a project from my Capstone in GIS Development course at UW-Madison. The objective was to create an interactive and mobile-friendly web page for a local park that allows users to provide input that would be returned to the map for viewing. I utilized a Mapbox tileset, Leaflet controls, and CARTO databases to store and receive data. The site also allows users to use their device location to find the three nearest points of interest in the park.
